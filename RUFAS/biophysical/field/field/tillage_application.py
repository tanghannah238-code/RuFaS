    Attributes
    ----------
    field_data : FieldData
        FieldData object that tracks attributes on the soil surface as they are updated by tillage applications

        Notes
        -----
        This method executes the actual mixing between the soil layers. Each layer in the soil profile can be either
        fully tilled, partially tilled, or not tilled at all. The method starts by determining how much matter will be
        mixed back into the profile based on the mixing fraction and the amount in the pool of each layer. Then it
        redistributes mixed matter back into the tilled layers of the profile. The amount mixed back in to a layer is
        determined by the ratio between the depth of tillage in the layer and the total overall tillage depth.

        This method acts in accordance with research from Dr. Xuesong Zhang which says that passive carbon is not
        present in the top soil layer and is not mixed into the top soil layer during tillage operations.
