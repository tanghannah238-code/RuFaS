**Heat units**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``HeatUnits``\ class manages the accumulation of heat units for a
crop on a daily basis. Crops have their own temperature range for growth
(*i.e.*, minimum, optimum, and maximum) and ``HeatUnits`` holds, for
each particular crop, all the methods that determine the absorption and
accumulation of heat units.

Its central method, ``absorb_heat_units()``, executes all the methods
that allow updating the **new heat units** absorbed on a given day and
its accumulation through the growing season.

The **accumulate heat units** method provides two alternatives for
calculating **new heat units** on a given day:

1. **Main method**: the mean air temperature (``mean_air_temperature``)
   is used as an input, and every degree above crop’s minimum
   temperature for growth is accumulated as heat units. With this
   method, where minimum temperature is dependant on the selected crop,
   heat units accumulated are always equal to the average air
   temperature (when above the minimum threshold).

2. **Alternative method**: new heat units are defined using the **heat
   unit temperature** (``heat_unit_temperature``) instead of the mean
   air temperature (``mean_air_temperature``). The selection of this
   method involves the daily calculation of **minimum heat unit
   temperature** and **maximum heat unit temperature** to determine the
   **heat unit temperature** on a given day:

**Minimum heat unit temperature** results from the comparison between
the minimum air temperature and the crop’s minimum temperature for
growth:

.. math::

    T_{\text{hu, min}} = 
     max(T_{\text{air, min}}, T_{\text{crop, min}})     

where :math:`T_{\text{hu, min}}` is the minimum heat unit temperature on
a given day (``minimum_heat_unit_temperature``),
:math:`T_{\text{air, min}}` is the minimum air temperature on a given
day (``min_air_temperature``), and :math:`T_{\text{crop, min}}` is the
base or minimum temperature for the crop to grow
(``minimum_temperature``).

**Maximum heat unit temperature** results from the comparison between
the maximum air temperature and the crop’s maximum temperature for
growth:

.. math::

    T_{\text{hu, max}} = 
     min(T_{\text{air, max}}, T_{\text{crop, max}})     

where :math:`T_{\text{hu, max}}` is the maximum heat unit temperature on
a given day (``maximum_heat_unit_temperature``),
:math:`T_{\text{air, max}}` is the maximum air temperature on a given
day (``max_air_temperature``), and :math:`T_{\text{crop, max}}` is the
maximum temperature for the crop to grow (``maximum_temperature``).

Finally, **heat unit temperature**, which represents the temperature at
which heat units are accumulated on a given day when considering both
crop and air thresholds, is calculated as follows:

.. math::

    T_{\text{hu}} = 
        \frac{T_{\text{hu, min}}+T_{\text{hu, max}}}{2}  

| where :math:`T_{\text{hu}}` is the heat unit temperature
  (``heat_unit_temperature``), :math:`T_{\text{hu, min}}` is the minimum
  heat unit temperature on a given day
| (``minimum_heat_unit_temperature``), and :math:`T_{\text{hu, max}}` is
  the maximum heat unit temperature on a given day
  (``maximum_heat_unit_temperature``).

Once the accumulation method for heat units is defined, the **assign new
heat unis** method calculates the new heat units on a given day:

.. math::

    hu = 
   \begin{cases}
       max(T_{\text{air}} - T_{\text{crop, min}}, 0)                                        & \text{Main method } \\ 
       max(T_{\text{hu}} - T_{\text{crop, min}}, 0)                                                   & \text{Alternative method}
   \end{cases} 

where :math:`hu` are the new heat units accumulated on a given day
(``heat_units``), :math:`T_{\text{air}}` is the mean air temperature on
a given day (``mean_air_temperature``), :math:`T_{\text{hu}}` is the
heat unit temperature (``heat_unit_temperature``), and
:math:`T_{\text{crop, min}}` is the base or minimum temperature for the
crop to grow (``minimum_temperature``).

Then, the newly acquired heat units are added to the accumulated heat
units to date through the the **add heat units** method:

.. math::

    hu_{\text{ac, i}} = 
        hu + hu_{\text{ac, i-1}}

where :math:`hu_{\text{ac, i}}` are the total heat units accumulated on
a given day (``accumulated_heat_units``), :math:`hu` are the new heat
units accumulated on a given day (``heat_units``), and
:math:`hu_{\text{ac, i-1}}` are the total heat units accumulated on the
previous day (``accumulated_heat_units``).
