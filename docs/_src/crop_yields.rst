**Crop Yields**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Crop yields in ``RuFaS`` are calculated by the ``Yields`` class.
``Yields`` contains the methods that determine the amount and
composition of harvestable crop production. Its main method function
``obtain_yields()`` executes all routines to determine production at the
time of harvest. As such, this function is only called once throughout a
crop’s growing season. This is typically done at cut/harvest time.

Reference
^^^^^^^^^

The ``Yields`` class is primarily an implementation of the methods
described in
`SWAT <https://swat.tamu.edu/media/99192/swat2009-theory.pdf>`__ section
5:2.4, with some minor modifications.

Details
^^^^^^^

This class utilizes and updates a number of attribute variables in the
course of its routines. Details about these attributes and the methods
of the class are given in more detail in the following subsections.

Input variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Yields`` class uses the following attributes, which are input
variables.

-  ``optimal_harvest_index``: potential harvest index for the plant at
   maturity under ideal growing conditions (unitless)
-  ``min_harvest_index``: harvest index for the plant in drought
   conditions; represents minimum harvest index allowed for the plant
   (unitless)
-  ``harvest_efficiency``: efficiency of the harvest operation: the
   proportion of the yield that will be extracted from the field [0, 1]
-  ``yield_nitrogen_fraction``: crop-specific expected fraction of
   nitrogen in yield
-  ``yield_phosphorus_fraction``: crop-specific expected fraction of
   phosphorus in yield
-  ``heat_fraction``: fraction of a plant’s potential heat units
   accumulated to date (unitless)
-  ``water_deficiency``: water deficiency factor for the plant
   (unitless)
-  ``above_ground_biomass``: plant biomass excluding roots; shoot
   biomass (kg/ha). This variable is updated by ``obtain_yields()``
-  ``biomass``: plant biomass (kg/ha)
-  ``dry_down_fraction``: proportion of plant biomass that is lost to
   dry-down [0, 1]
-  ``nitrogen``: nitrogen stored in plant biomass (kg/ha)
-  ``phosphorus``: phosphorus stored in plant biomass (kg/ha)
-  ``optimal_nitrogen_fraction``: optimal fraction of nitrogen in the
   plant biomass for current growth stage (unitless)
-  ``optimal_phosphorus_fraction``: optimal fraction of phosphorus in
   the plant biomass for current growth stage (unitless)
-  ``user_harvest_index``: (**Optional**) a user-specified harvest index
   (unitless); if given, ‘harvest-index-override’ is triggered

Calculated variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Yields`` class calculates the following attributes with its
methods. Unless otherwise specified, these attributes are updated by
``obtain_yields()``.

-  ``potential_harvest_index``: potential harvest index for a given day.
-  ``harvest_index``: harvest index for a given day; fraction of
   above-ground plant biomass that is harvestable economic yield
   (unitless)
-  ``crop_yield``: total amount (kg/ha) of the desired crop product
-  ``yield_collected``: amount (kg/ha) of the desired crop product to be
   removed from the field
-  ``yield_residue``: amount of residue created; unharvested yield
   (kg/ha)
-  ``collected_nitrogen``: nitrogen contained in the harvested yield
   (kg/ha)
-  ``collected_phosphorus``: phosphorus contained in the harvested yield
   (kg/ha)

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

``Yields`` has the following property attributes:

-  ``is_mature``: has the crop reached maturity (true/false)?
-  ``has_given_harvest_index``: has the user provided the
   ``user_harvest_index`` attribute (true/false)? If ``True``, the
   ‘harvest index override’ is triggered.

Routine/algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``obtain_yields()`` method follows the following procedure

1. determine the ``harvest_index``.

   -  First, ``potential_harvest_index`` is calculated from
      ``heat_fraction`` and ``optimal_harvest_index``, via the
      ``determine_potential_harvest_index()`` static function.
   -  Then, ``harvest_index`` is calculated from
      ``potential_harvest_index``, ``min_harvest_index``, and
      ``water_deficiency`` via the ``adjust_harvest_index`` static
      function.
   -  Alternatively, if ``user_harvest_index`` is given,
      ``harvest_index`` is directly set to this value (harvest index
      override)

2. check if the crop has reached maturity (``is_mature``) and, if it
   has, trigger the dry-down process. The new ``above_ground_biomass``
   value is calculated with ``adjust_biomass_for_dry_down()`` using the
   pre-dry-down ``above_ground_biomass`` and the ``dry_down_fraction``.
3. calculate the biomass of the yield product (``crop_yield``).

   -  if the ``harvest_index`` is less than 1, yield biomass is
      calculated from the ``above_ground_biomass`` and the
      ``harvest_index`` value via the
      ``determine_yield_from_shoot_biomass()`` static method.
   -  if ``harvest_index`` is greater than 1, it means that both above-
      and below-ground biomass are part of the product. yield is
      calculated with ``determine_yield_from_total_biomass()`` from
      ``biomass`` and ``harvest_index``.

4. calculate the amount of yield that will be removed from the field
   during harvest. This is done with the ``determine_extracted_yield()``
   static function from ``crop_yield``, and ``harvest_efficiency``.
5. calculate the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus contained in the
   yield product (``collected_nitrogen``, ``collected_phosphorus``,
   respectively)

   -  this is done by multiplying the ``yield_collected`` by
      ``optimal_nitrogen_fraction`` or ``optimal_phosphorus_fraction``.
   -  Alternatively, when the ‘harvest index override’ has triggered,
      these values are calculated by multiplying ``yield_collected`` by
      the species-specific expected nutrient fraction
      (``yield_nitrogen_fraction``, ``yield_phosphorus_fraction``)

6. calculate the un-harvest yield that will be recycled into the soil as
   plant residue. This is done with the
   ``determine_unextracted_yield()`` from ``crop_yield`` and
   ``harvest_efficiency``.
